          The Sounds of Freedom is an audio film series inspired by the lives and experiences of the young men and

          Through this story, we hope to bring Kenyans closer to their history by welcoming them to immersive

              <p>This month will highlight all the main demonstrations that were made in the history of the fight for
                independence, starting with the protest for the release of Harry Thuku in 1922. Harry Thuku was arrested
                on March 14th and protests continued all the way till the 16th, ending in the unfortunate death of Mary
                Muthoni Nyanjiru, a Kenyan political activist remembered for leading the protest. She was shot and
                killed by the police while leading this protest. We will therefore release a special episode in honour
                of this history and release it at the very location this demonstration occured i.e. present day Harry
                Thuku Road.</p>

                Mt. Kenya, and organise hikes with a special tour that will help people discover more about how the
                freedom fighters navigated this forest and used it as their defence while they fought for against the
                British.
