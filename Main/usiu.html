    <div class="text">
      <p>Dear Community,</p>
      <p>We would like to take a moment to express our heartfelt appreciation for your enthusiastic participation in the
        Sounds of Freedom Exhibition organised by the French Embassy in Kenya and hosted by USIU-Africa. It was a
        privilege for the African Fiction Academy to be part of this remarkable event celebrating the achievements of
        international alumni educated in France. The event provided an invaluable platform for students,alumni, and
        guests from the cultural and creative industry to connect, share experiences, and foster meaningful
        collaborations. It is through such initiatives that we can continue to strengthen the bonds of the global alumni
        community.
      </p>
      <p>We extend our sincere gratitude to all the distinguished panellists, including Dr Mathieu Gu√©rin, the French
        Embassy Attach√© for Science and Higher Education, Deputy Head of Cooperation and Cultural Affairs Department,
        Prof. Sylvester Mutua, a Journalism, Communication, and Film Production Studies lecturer at USIU-Africa, and
        M≈©tana Wanjƒ©ra, the Founder and Creative Producer of the African Fiction Academy and the creator of the Sounds
        of Freedom project. Their perspectives on the unique international representation and exposure offered by the
        university truly added depth and richness to the event. We would also like to thank our moderator. We would also
        like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Mercy Gicovi, the Campus France Communications Officer, for her
        exceptional guidance and facilitation during the enlightening panel discussion. Her adept moderation skills not
        only ensured a seamless flow of ideas but also fostered an engaging and thought-provoking environment.
      </p>
      <p>To all the attendees, we extend our deepest appreciation for your active participation and engagement
        throughout the event. Your presence and enthusiasm created an inspiring atmosphere that highlighted the power of
        education and the immense potential for international collaboration.</p>
      <p>Lastly, we want to express our gratitude to the African Fiction Academy team, whose dedication and hard work
        contributed to the success of our involvement in the USIU-Africa & France Alumni Creative Industry Exhibition.
        We are proud to be part of an organisation that values the transformative impact of education and literature in
        shaping a brighter future.
      </p>
      <p>Once again, thank you all for your support, and we look forward to continued collaboration and exploration of
        new horizons together.
