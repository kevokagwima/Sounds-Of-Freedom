        <h4>Heroes Day 2021</h4>
        <p>During Kenya’s Heroes Day
          celebrations on October 20 2021, we
          released the first episode of our audio film as a celebration of the heroes who fought for Kenya’s
          independence. The event was held at
          the Alliance Française, Nairobi, Kenya.
        </p>
        <p>The premiere episode follows the
          story of two young men who had
          been recruited to join the war and are
          now lost in the forest trying to find
          their way to meet Dedan Kimathi and
          join the Kenya Land and Freedom
          Army, more popularly known as the
          Mau Mau.

          The experience starts in pitch darkness, with a spoken word poem called Kaa Ukijua: A soldier's. The soul of
          the young warrior cries out for poetic justice.</p>
        <p>
          The film too starts in darkness, as the characters are
          themselves lost in the dark forest. After being rescued by the Mau Mau and surviving the homeguard ambush, the
          audience find themselves at the oathing ceremony, and the stage lights up to reveal the Patriots Sanctuary, a
          space for reflection on the ideals of freedom and patriotism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the lights come on, we invite our audience
          to a Q&A session as well as open access to the Patriots Sanctuary for them to freely experience it and
          expresswhat freedom means to them.

        <p>As the Sounds of Freedom adventure grows
          into more immersive experiences, we would
          like to present First Patriots, an immersive
          paintball shooting game inspired by the story
          of Kenya’s fight for freedom. First Patriots is
          Kenya’s first live action gaming experience
          based on historical events, and it is in
          response to our audiences' need to rediscover
          their history and culture through gaming</p>
        <p>In history, brother was set against brother,
          and sister against sister, all for the expansion
          of Britain’s colonial agenda. The resultant war
          caused not only the loss of our land and
          freedom, but also the destruction of our
          social fabric and generations of hatred
          between communities. First Patriots brings
          this war to you, for you to decide the fate of
          Kenya. Freedom is not a game.</p>

          of headphones. Together with your teams, you'll listen
          to the first episode of the series, the prologue. Once

          you're going to game out and the question now will
          be, what side will you be playing for? This will be
          totally by chance and you will be expected to pick
          your role from a box. This will seal your fate as you will
          either pick a Mau Mau or Home Guard card.</p>
        <p>Once the choice is made, you will receive training
          that will help you better understand the terrain an
